Proposition 30 in California, starting in 2023, proposes a tax increase on high-income earners to fund programs for zero-emission vehicles and wildfire prevention. The tax is set to conclude by 2043 or earlier if the state maintains greenhouse gas emissions at expected levels for three consecutive years. The study evaluates Proposition 30's effectiveness in helping California achieve its emission reduction goal of 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Specifically, it assesses the impact of the proposed tax allocation, with 80% dedicated to the Zero Emission Vehicle program and 20% to Wildfire Response and Prevention Programs. The study aims to provide insights into the proposition's potential contribution to California's environmental objectives.
