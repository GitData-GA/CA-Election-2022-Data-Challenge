# California 2022 Proposition 30 Analysis

<img src="https://caelection2022.gitdata.ga/background.gif" width=100px />

## Objectives:

We figured out whether more electric vehicles can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Based on the tax revenue and the additional $10 billion funded by the government, we will find out how many electric vehicles can be used and the amount of greenhouse gas that can be reduced. We also found out how much greenhouse gas can be reduced after funding the Wildfire Response and Prevention Programs. Finally, we evaluated if our goal can be achieved, which is whether greenhouse gas emissions can be cut to 80% below the 1990 level by 2050.
